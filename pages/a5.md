# Reading and discussion
<br>

We will read at least one reading per week. The readings will be listed on the schedule.
Every student is required to read the reading and leave at least two comments [in this discussion document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15iewnPwMyY7HCdiLtAz6kZggRniNUYhjTFKGGVqpoQQ/edit).
Everyone is also expected to actively engage in the reading discussion in the meeting.

### Questions to consider

- What are the main theses of the reading?
- What surprised you?
- What other texts, projects or people did the reading make you think of?
- How does this reading relate to your or other student projects?
