# Project 4: Elastic Spaces
<br>
Imagine a new space for remote togetherness for multiple parties. Consider the physical, the virtual and the space in between. Define the rules and protocols that define this space. Think how this space is different from other spaces, think about the form: Does it expand, shrink, accelerate, decelerate, enable, restrain?
