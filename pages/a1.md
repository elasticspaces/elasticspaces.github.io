In teams of 2, choose from one of the following tools and find new ways to use/misappropriate/hack it. Write a one paragraph description about your idea and experience. Also take a video of using it, for instance through capturing the screen on both ends. Be ready to present it during the next class.
Your presentation should be 3min., with 3min. afterwards for discussion.

Submit your group's presentation (google slides or PDF only) through the [assignment form]({{ layout.submissionform }}) and individually, your [peer assessments]({{ layout.peerassessform }}) by **Wednesday 11:59pm** the day before your scheduled time to present.

### Part I: Analyze One Platform

Pick an online collaboration platform, for instance one of these:
- Zoom
- Chat (Line/wechat/whatsapp)
- Google doc
- Google spreadsheet
- Snapchat
- Instagram
- Miro
- Mozilla Hubs
- Traditional voice messaging
- here.fm

Describe the tool and the intended use briefly. Consider:
- Since when has it been around?

### Part II: Propose a modification



### Part III: For Discussion

End your presentation with 3 questions for discussion with your classmates. Good starters are things (e.g. design or implementation decisions) you learned which you want to apply to your assignments, things that may have been points of disagreement amongst your teammates, or things that may have been confusing.
