In teams of 2, pick one of the existing remote collaboration tools. Together, collaboratively, find a new, unusual, beautiful or poetic way of using the tool. Test the boundaries of the constraints the tool has. Document in a video (1 min).


Document your experience in a one minute video, for instance through screen capturing on both ends. 

Upload your group's video to the shared google Drive. Write a one paragraph description about your idea and experience. Submit your [project]({{ layout.submissionform }}) by **Wednesday 11:59pm** the day before your scheduled time to present.

Be ready to present it during the next class.


[Pick an online collaboration platform and add your name here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lfr6328Ewf3uEwu3q9e_N4DK9OPmgIzKAgsyYVmWPUQ/edit#gid=0)

### Some notes

- Try to constrain yourself to one functionality (i.e. only text if you use a chat tool)
- Explore the possibility space within your chosen functionality
- It has to work as a one minute video, so think of the narrative arc of it
- Donâ€™t recreate what already exists, i.e. an existing Zoom Game.
- Have fun!



### Grading Criteria
- How novel and unusual your hack is
- Aesthetic quality as a hack
- How well it works in the video
â€“ The collaboration between you two
