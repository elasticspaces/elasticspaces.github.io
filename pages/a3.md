# Project 3: Remote Senses
<br>

Create a visceral experience of connection through remote senses. Imagine for example, how a physical interface could for convey an ambient sense of presence, rather than pushing notifications. Consider how it relates to the body and what senses besides visual and auditory it can address. Describe aspects like form, scale and materiality of the device.  

Submit your [report]({{ layout.submissionform }}) and individually, your [peer assessments]({{ layout.peerassessform }}) for Project 3 by the due dates indicated below:

### Week 1: Precedent research / Hardware hack
**Due 10/14, 11:59pm**

#### Part 1: Research 
After having completed Protocol and having read the first reading, we will start by collecting references. In the [slack channel # project3-remotesenses](https://elasticspacesfall2020.slack.com/archives/C01C0EWEW2X) please post 3 items you find relevant for this topic:   
- a design/art/HCI precedent project that you find relevant for remote senses. 
- An academic paper, an article or piece of text you find relevant for remote senses
- A fictional example from a book or a movie 

For each of the three, add a short paragraph of why you personally chose this reference and why you think it could be relevant for Remote Senses. Be prepared to speak to it in class. Feel free to add more items and you are encouraged to react and comment on each otherâ€™s research.




### Week 2: Create mockup
**Due 10/21, 11:59pm**

### Week 3: Create prototype
**Due 10/28, 11:59pm**

### Week 4: Create final
**Due 11/4, 11:59pm**

### Grading Criteria
- Novelty of idea and concept: Did you find and consider related work?
- Communication and documentation of your project: Do you have a video? Is your audience, purpose and context well-described? 
- Technical prototype and execution: Does it convey your idea and concept well? 
- Process documentation: Evolution of your project ideas and prototype iterations
